# Security Policy

## Supported versions
We aim to support the Moodle versions declared compatible in `version.php` (e.g., Moodle 4.4+ for release 1.0.0). If a given core version reaches EOL, we may drop active support for that branch.

## Reporting a vulnerability
- Preferred contact: **info@unbitsoftware.com**
- Please provide a minimal reproduction, affected Moodle version, PHP version, and any relevant logs. Avoid sharing production data.
- If the issue is sensitive, mark the email subject with `[SECURITY]`.

## Disclosure policy
- We acknowledge receipt within **3 business days**.
- We validate and reproduce the report. If confirmed, we prepare a fix and schedule a maintenance release.
- We coordinate disclosure and credits with the reporter. We prefer responsible disclosure after a fixed release is available.

## Scope
- This policy applies to the Moodle plugin code contained in this repository (`mod_chimpaigo`).
- The external chimpAIgo! platform (AI engine, services, and infrastructure) is out of scope for this repository and handled under its own operational policies.
